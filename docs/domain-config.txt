Solution found!

the problem was when i set up the firebase project i used a different domain and it defaulted to firebases default project domain "{projectname}.firebase.com" . i tried creating a new account not knowing firebase generates a service account for you automatically. this firebase cloud account can be found by going to

project overview ( top left) > project settings > service accounts > manage service account permissions (top right).

this will will take you to the google cloud page associated with your firebase web project from their you will click the 3 lines in the top left of the google cloud developer page and go to

Api's & Services > credentials (left hand vertical bar)

here you should see your google-generated OAuth2.0 settings. With these you can update them from

"{projectname}.firebase.com" to "https://www.{yourdomain}.com"

and for the redirect link from

"{projectname}.firebase.com/__/auth/handler"
to "https://www.{yourdomain}.com/__/auth/handler"
